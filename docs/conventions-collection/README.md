# Conventions Collection — Team Review Draft

**Status:** Draft — gathering team feedback before authoring  
**Date:** 2026-07-16 / 2026-07-17  
**Sources:** 6 documents from 3 contributors (Jean, Watson, Kiara)  
**Interactive preview:** [preview.html](preview.html) (download and open locally — dark-theme tabbed view)

## What this is

Three team members independently reviewed their workspaces, project logs, and working patterns to surface conventions, patterns, and tools worth promoting into the Lab-OS handbook. This PR collects **all six source documents** into one place so the team can:

1. **Comment on individual entries** — agree, disagree, propose rewording
2. **Flag de-duplication** — several items appear in 2–3 sources independently (strongest promote signal)
3. **Propose landing order** — some entries have dependencies; the team should agree on sequencing
4. **Decide what needs authoring vs. copying** — some items are ready-to-copy files; others need to be written from scratch

> **This PR deliberately contains no changes to rules, templates, or the handbook itself.** It is a review surface only. Promotion PRs follow after the team agrees on the list.

## Source documents

| # | Document | Author | Method | Entries |
|---|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 | conventions-to-promote-2026-07-16 | Jean | Deep extraction (5 parallel readers on smart_wardrobe + job-curator) | 13 |
| 2 | lab-os-promotion-review (full) | Watson | Fork-vs-upstream diff + machine-wide sweep of all lab codebases | 38 |
| 3 | lab-os-promotion-review (fork-only) | Watson | Fork-only subset of #2 (entries 1–17 identical) | 17 |
| 4 | lab-os-promotion-review-jean | Jean | Fleet/CAMELS workspace review (4 parallel readers + 2nd pass) | 28 |
| 5 | claude-conventions-jean | Jean | Operator-side ("my side of the keyboard") | ~6 sections |
| 6 | steering-conventions | Kiara | Operator-side steering conventions | ~6 sections |

**De-duplication notes:**
- Doc #3 is a **strict subset** of Doc #2 (entries 1–17 byte-identical; machine-wide addendum 18–38 absent)
- `claude-conventions-jean.md` has an exact duplicate in Downloads (byte-identical)

## Convergent findings (independently derived in 2+ sources — highest-confidence promotes)

These items appeared independently across sources without either author naming the same thing. Independent reinvention is the strongest signal a convention should be ratified.

| Convention | Sources | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Dependency seam** — every external dep behind one config-swappable interface | Jean-deep A1 | NEEDS AUTHORING |
| **Soft-degrade by default** — failure degrades to a working path, never crashes | Jean-deep A2 | NEEDS AUTHORING |
| **Fail-fast config guards** — invariants as hard boot errors | Jean-deep B1 | NEEDS AUTHORING |
| **Mocked tests ≠ live verification** — green suite proves wiring, not live value | Jean-deep C1, Jean-workspace #1, Watson #21 | SHARPEN existing |
| **Evidence over assertion** — probe primary source, distrust even your own claims | Jean-deep C3, Jean-workspace #3 | SHARPEN existing |
| **"Done" means pushed** — commit + push together, verify the push landed | Jean-deep D1, Watson #5 | NEEDS AUTHORING |
| **One-writer-per-tree** — each tree has exactly one owner; cross-tree = handoff | Jean-workspace #10 | NEEDS AUTHORING (at lab altitude) |
| **4-part status summary** — Verified / Not yet verified / Caveats / Next step | Jean-workspace #21 | NEEDS AUTHORING |

### Operator-Side Conventions (Jean + Kiara)

These are "my side of the keyboard" — how the human steers the agent. Not handbook rules, but shared vocabulary worth documenting.

**Jean's patterns:** "do it for me" / "don't act, tell me" mode-switching · "go" / "yes" per-action authorization · "make me a prompt for FM" delegation · "ask me one question at a time" · "why are you celebrating" honesty pushback · /roundtable, /broadcast, /fleet, /compact rituals

**Kiara's patterns:** "resume" / "autonomous, task-by-task" mode-switching · "go" + rider ("stop only for genuine forks") · "consider that a standing instruction" promotion · "hold on" wrong-assumption interrupt · "confirm with evidence" / "tell me what correct looks like" honesty · full sprint-close verification ritual

## Already upstream — do NOT re-promote

These are ratified in lab-os already. Cite the `.claude/rules/0x-*` file as canonical.

- SDD lifecycle, PRD/Design-doc/Plan formats, Verification checkpoint, Review checkpoint
- Build = delegate to subagents, Autonomous-loop safety contract
- Merge bar + PR lifecycle + commits, Logging standard, Docs standard
- Data protection, Operating philosophy
- White-label desktop starter (PR #41), CLAUDE.local.md overlay (issue #53)
- Rules 01–05 (byte-identical via symlink), 05-network-boundaries (promoted from Jean's workspace)
- Overclaim-scrub / "gate green, run unpiped"

## How to comment

1. **Agree with an entry** — react with 👍 or leave a short "+1 — we use this too"
2. **Disagree or flag a concern** — comment on the specific line with your reasoning
3. **Propose a merge** — if two entries are the same thing, comment "merge with [ID]"
4. **Suggest landing order** — Watson proposed: W2 → W3 → W7 → W10 → everything else
5. **Claim authorship** — if you want to write the rule file for a NEEDS AUTHORING entry, comment "I'll author this"

---

## Suggested landing order (Watson's dependency analysis)

```
W2 (spec-log/bundles) → W3 (GLOSSARY) → W7 (/log) → W10 (engineering skills, depends on W3 + W7) → everything else in any order
```

Entries W1, W5, W6, W8, W9, W11, W12, W13, W14 are independent.  
Entries W15–W17 are authoring tasks with no file dependency.  
W17 reads best landed after W6 (references pr-review-loop as the quality bar).
